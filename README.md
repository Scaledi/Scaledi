Cool! I heard this works? can you see this??? or I guess.... 
# Hello World?
it is I... scaledi. 

I am not sure what I want to do with my life... so I take it day by day.... thats the awesome part of life. it is what you make it. I am trying to make the most of it... make of that as you will. its fun... but also a bit of a issue, I guess, having no direction? I hope I find it soon.

Until then... I am having a blast making random stuff. it may be video games, discord bots, or irl robots. its a bit unpredictable.

I also enjoy skiing ⛷️, biking 🚴, gaming 🎮, camping 🏕️, and dogging 🐕... uhh... dogging 🐕?

anyway... come join my journey in life with me... how you ask? thats a good question I dont have the answer to.
